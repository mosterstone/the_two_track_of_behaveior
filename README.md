note my action of the day
I write this to split my action and thinking.
In the past , I made this mistake all the time , and that's I always repalce action with thoughts.That is awful, because I seems to understand many things, actually, I do nothing.
So I think it's time to split them ,and supervise my action. Here, it's obvious how much I'm doing, so I doing have my strong hallucinationsã€‚
That's be all (temporary) , I will continue to completing my codes, my English , also my action
